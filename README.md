# Introduction to Bioinformatics and Data Science
## Practicals

This repo provides an index to the practicals from the Introduction to Bioinformatics and Data Science module from 
[BSc Bioinformatics Degree apprenticeship](https://www.anglia.ac.uk/bioinformatics) at [Anglia Ruskin University](https://www.anglia.ac.uk/). Anglia Ruskin Students should refer to the [Module Canvas Page](https://canvas.anglia.ac.uk/courses/1490) rather than this page. 


<h2>Practicals Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Perform simple programming in Python.</li>
<li>Communicate programming results in a report using Jupyter notebooks.</li>
<li>Critically review other students&rsquo; code, developing an understanding that code readability is important.</li>
<li>Use the *x (Unix, Linux or OSX) command line terminal for simple file manipulation</li>
</ol>
<h2>Preparation for the practicals</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this practical, we will start by using the<span>&nbsp;</span><br /><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science" target="_parent">DataCamp online course<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Intro to Python for Data Science</em></a><span>&nbsp;<br /></span>to get familiar with Python and then using the to do some simple sequence analysis and manipulation to show how Python can be used for Bioinformatics.
<ul>
<li>We will just be using Chapters 1, 2 and 3 (you can skip Chapter 4 on NumPy).</li>
<li>It would be great to work through all three sections before starting the practical exercises activities but there is no problem doing the just the Chapter needed and then the activity.</li>
<li>If you already know some Python then you could use the DataCamp course as revision or start on the activities and see how you get on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
   
<li>For exercise C we will prepare using Chapters 3 and 4 from the
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science" target="_blank">DataCamp online course: Intermediate Python for Data Science</a>.</li>
</ul>
